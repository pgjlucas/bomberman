# Bomberman
## Scope
Development of my version of the well-known game Bomberman.

## Description
Two player game. The goal is to defeat the other one by exploring a map, using bombs and finding bonuses.

Two themes are included:
 - Rick & Morty
 - Pulp Fiction

Sounds aren't available, the files architecture should be the same as for the images.
